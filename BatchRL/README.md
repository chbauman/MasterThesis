# All the python code 

The file `BatchRL.py` is the main function, run this to run
everything. 

## Running on Euler

When running on Euler, first run:

```console
$ module load python
$ module load hdf5
```

to load the necessary libraries. 
You might need to install some additional
python libraries, do this using the flag `--user`.
Also remember to copy the data if it has changed 
since the last time. The command for doing this
is in [Data](../Data).
