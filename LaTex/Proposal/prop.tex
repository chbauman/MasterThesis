	\section{Introduction}
	\label{sec:intro}
	
	Electric vehicles (EVs) that allow bidirectional charging
	can be used as batteries in smart homes to store energy
	e.g. from photovoltaic (PV) systems and used later on. 
	When consuming mentioned energy it has to be in such a way that
	the users requirements on the use of the EV are still satisfied.
	Therefore this project tries to find a control strategy using
	reinforcement learning that jointly controls the charging / 
	discharging of the EV and the home energy systems.
	
	\section{Objectives and Goals}
	
	The goal of this thesis is to learn a control strategy using model-free
	reinforcement learning from past data and implement it in a real-world
	application at Empa. 
	
	\subsection{Base Problem}
	
	Control of EV charging and heating considering energy
	from PV. The driving patterns of the EV are assumed to be known
	at least a few hours ahead. 
	
	\subsection{Extended Problem}	
	
	Same setup as in the base problem, but 
	adding air conditioning and natural ventilation as control 
	objectives. Use weather forecasts to improve control strategy.
	
	\textbf{Optional:} Analyze impact of larger number of EVs.
	Use real-time electricity prices with forecast model. 
	
	
	\section{Methods of Investigation / Implementation}
	
	As a reinforcement learning algorithm, fitted Q-iteration
	will be used as is done e.g. in \cite{7401112, 7178338, 8727484, 7056534}.
	The authors of \cite{7401112} even extend it to take into account
	predictions of future state information. 
	The implementation will be done in python.
	
	\section{Background / Prior Work}
	
	Blah blah, papers.
	
	\section{Timetable and Milestones}
	
	\subsection{Task 1}
	
	Finalize the scope of control problem, i.e. build the final list of inputs  (measurements, information signals, past data) and outputs (P/Q charging/discharging profiles at Empa side) and 
	come up with a ML-based control strategy.
	
	\subsection{Task 2}
	
	Building prediction models for the measurements of interest and doing dimension reduction. Get results from past measurement and / or simulated data.
	
	\subsection{Task 3}
	
	Implementing the control strategy at Empa.
	
	\subsection{Task 4}
	
	Test implementation and analyze results.
	
	\subsection{Task 5}
	
	Finalize report and presentation.
